A Gitch in the Data

Working part-time as an artist allows Jerald to explore. Explore is a simple word.
In reality when Jerald explores, his mind ticks over in a chaos of patterns,
(as he describes it).
The whole process brings forth a myriad of ideas. Some he just parks. Others,
he acts upon. A thought is a highly regarded entity for Jerald. A path to run down no
matter the cost. But unlike most, the paths that he treads touch the limits of
this physical world.

To the astonishment of family and loved ones I consider myself an associate of this
so called 'genius'.  And yes, I say that in quotes. For everyday language fails when
trying to capture who he is. There's something outer worldly about him that's
too enticing to ignore. And it is for this basic emotion that has led me to the
beginnings of a somewhat dark adventure.
