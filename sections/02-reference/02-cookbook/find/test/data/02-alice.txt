Alice in Otherland

Alice was beginning to get tired of sitting around with her sister on the bank.
Neither had anything to do, and she was contemplating on making a daisy-chain.
But the effort involved seemed too much to even contemplate.
Just then, at the corner of her eye she spotted a rabbit. It was no ordinary rabbit either.
For this rabbit was not only a light shade of pink, it was also carrying a tablet. 
One could say it was a most modern rabbit.
