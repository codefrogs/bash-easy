DNA: Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid

It was in 1953 that the structure of DNA was found by James Watson and Francis Crick.


Although DNA itself was first isolated in 1869 by the Swiss biochemist Johann Miescher.


It was only after the X-ray analysis by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins that Watson and Crick could piece together the structure of DNA.


Then in the 1970s, nearly 20 years after the discovery of its structure, scientists worked out how to do DNA sequencing.


It was then in 1983 that biochemist Kary Mullis invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.


This meant that it was then possible to make billions of a target DNA sequence copies in just a few hours.


In 2012 Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna discovered a molecular tool called Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).


This tool enabled scientists to edit DNA, i.e. remove and insert new DNA sequences.


This was considered to be the 'holy grail' of genetics.


The two researchers received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020 for their work.
