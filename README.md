# bash-easy

Example bash scripts, and useful notes.

Basy-easy is for those new to bash.
The intent is for the reader to go through each section,
and try out each script in order.

To make best use of the bash scripts open up the script in your favourite Bash
IDE (Integrated Development Environment), and run within the editor. That way
you can compare the output of scripts with the source code.

We recommend using the 'Atom' IDE with the 'platformio-ide-terminal' package.
